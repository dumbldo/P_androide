 **Visualising the value landscape to better understand reinforcement learning**

This project consists of developing tools for visualising the value landscape and gradient descent trajectories to better understand the dynamics of reinforcement learning algorithms.
Our tools were applied to the classic **Swimmer** control environment and **OpenAI Gym Pendulum-v0** using Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm,with diffrent alternate slightly changes the policy update rule.

 We use the implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in PyTorch of : https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3
